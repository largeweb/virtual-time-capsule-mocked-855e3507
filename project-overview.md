# Project Overview

Project Name: Virtual Time Capsule (Mocked)

Description: A web application that allows users to create and curate personal time capsules. Users can create an account, compose a message, upload a photo, set a future "open date," and then receive a simulated experience of the capsule being "opened" on that date. The storage and scheduling of the opening are all mocked on the frontend.

Features:

*   Capsule Creation: Form for users to compose a message, upload a photo, and set a future date.
*   Mocked Scheduled Delivery: A simulated opening experience where the stored message and photo are displayed, triggered by a date chosen by the user.
*   Basic Subscription Model: Simple account creation system with a default subscription. (Mocked)
*   User-Friendly Interface: Clean, intuitive design for creating and viewing capsules.

Technology Stack:

*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
